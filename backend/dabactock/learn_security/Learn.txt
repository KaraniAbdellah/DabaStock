// We Have Authentication Stateful vs Stateless
/*
    Authentication Stateful (with memory):
        uui: is generator that generate id of session
        bcrypt: for password encryption
        in session we store "username" and "role"
        we send session to browser, and we store it cookie (set-cookie)
        each time we session id to server verify
        each session has time out
        NOTE: if html code generate in server side --> GOOD

    Authentication Stateless (without memory):
        We generate token (jwt) --> we can not store token
        NOTE: if html code generate in client code --> GOOD
